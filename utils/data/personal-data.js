	description: "Senior Software Engineer and System Architect with a people-first mindset. Over the past several years, I’ve led the design and implementation of scalable, modular software architectures across various industries, including mining, engineering, and SaaS platforms. My approach typically involves balancing real-world business requirements with technical best practices—ensuring systems are maintainable, secure, and performance-optimized. I’ve designed both monolithic and microservice- based systems using Node.js, Express, and containerized environments (Docker), often integrating React, AngularJS, or Vue.js on the frontend.I regularly architect full - stack solutions on cloud platforms like Google Cloud, define API contracts, database schemas(MongoDB / PostgreSQL), and CI / CD pipelines, while ensuring smooth communication between teams and stakeholders throughout the process. My architectural work is not only hands - on but also collaborative—I place a strong focus on documentation, versioning strategies, and aligning the solution with long - term business goals.",
